/**
 * Health indicator for the Portfolios microservice.
 *
 * <p>This component implements Spring Boot's {@link org.springframework.boot.actuate.health.HealthIndicator}
 * to provide a simple "up" health status for the service. The returned {@link Health} contains
 * basic metadata that can be exposed by Actuator endpoints (for example, /actuator/health).
 * The health details include:
 * - "service": logical name of the service ("portfolios-ms")
 * - "status": human-readable status ("running")
 * This indicator is intentionally simple and always reports UP. In the future, it can be
 * extended to include downstream checks (databases, external APIs, etc.) and return a more
 * detailed health status.
